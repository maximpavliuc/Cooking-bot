# Revised_ChatGPT_Cooking_bot

I wanted to create a chatbot for my first individual project. I started to look on google to find some code that I could implement. I quickly found that I was going to have to learn possibly a new langauge and use sources I havent used yet. I decided to go with https://beebom.com/how-build-own-ai-chatbot-with-chatgpt-api/. the reason I chose this was the fact that it was easy to read and understand..partially. 

I had to learn some things in Python which we haven't discussed yet in class. I also had to learn a new web interface.. Gradio. 
I ran into the challeneg of not being able to really add style to my project beacuse of the Interface on Gradio. 
It seemed like I would need to build this from scratch all over and I just did not have the time to do so.
I did figure out how to add a background image and move the boxes slightly so I could put a little personalization into it.

I wanted my chatbot to specifically create vegan recipies using the ingredients the user has at home. You can enter literally any random vegan ingredient and it will create a recipe.

I also added a vegan fact after the output. 

Overall, I was proud of this accomplishment. I realized that leanring a language on my own is okay. I am not afraid of that anymore. I also learned that it takes a lot of time to be able to dive into something new and really learn the ins and outs of it. My time management was pretty good as I did finish the MVP's of the project with time to dive deeper into Gradio.
